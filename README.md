# IGAFrac
IGAFrac (short for Isogeometric Analysis of Fracture) is a MATLAB code for phase-field fracture simulation. The full source code will be made public, once the corresponding article is accepted for publication.

Pre-print is available (here)[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356456710_A_robust_monolithic_solver_for_phase-field_fracture_integrated_with_fracture_energy_based_arc-length_method_and_under-relaxation].
